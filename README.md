Game Title: A Good Strong Cuppa

All human beings need a nice cup of tea to get through their day. Chris, the instructor of British Columbia 
Institute of Technology, is a huge fan of tea. He has a very strong and strict taste of having tea, which is
matcha and ginger tea. 

In this game, player's goal is to make all different kinds of tea required for each level
and hence make the character, aka Chris, maintain his caffeine level. Our final goal is to give Chris
enough tea so that he can go work with good energy.

[Level 1] Today is Saturday. Raining hard outside. C'mon! It's Saturday morning. He's worked hard for the entire week.
He wants to stay dry with his cozy blanket and just start his day with some nice cup of tea. 
He decides to make tea by himself at home. 
In this level, the player needs to collect all the required materials to make a cup of matcha tea while maintaining 
positive caffeine level.
There may be some challenges while achieving the goal.
Once making the tea, his caffeine level will increase. The player achieves level 2.

[Level 2] Today is Sunday. Now he needs some legit matcha. Oops, all of his favourite starbucks stores are closed due to
maintenance issue. He decided to go to the grocery store and get some materials to serve himself a nice good matcha tea.
In this level, the player needs to collect all the required materials to make a cup of matcha tea while maintaining 
positive caffeine level.
There may be some challenges while achieving the goal.
Once making the tea, his caffeine level will increase. The player achieves level 3.

[Level 3] Today is Monday. Oh, boy. He doesn't feel too well. He must've caught cold while getting groceries yesterday.
He needs warm and soothing ginger-turmeric tea. Ah, a farmers market comes near his house and he heard that the vendor 
that sells the best organic ginger and turmeric that he has ever tried. 
In this level, the player needs to collect all the required materials to make a cup of ginger-turmeric tea while 
maintaining 
positive caffeine level.
There may be some challenges while achieving the goal.
Once making the tea, his caffeine level will increase. The player needs to fight against the final boss, which is 
Joey and Hsin.

[Final Boss] To win the game, you need to win from the battle with Joey and Hsin. They will bother you with 
python-related questions. You have to answer the question right and then make to go work!

*** There will be some bonus item which will cheer you up while playing the game to increase the caffeine level 
before you make and drink the tea. You can make use of it.
